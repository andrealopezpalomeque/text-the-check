## Quick Reference

- **Brand colors**: Primary `#4A90D9`, Accent `#34D399`, Danger `#EF4444`
- **Fonts**: Outfit 600 (wordmark), Nunito 800 (headings), DM Sans 400 (body)
- **Logo rule**: Receipt has organic curves — never straighten to a rectangle
- **Dark mode is primary**: `#0C1017` background, always design dark-first

## Logo Evolution

The receipt symbol is evolving from the original Looka-generated logo toward a hand-crafted SVG that maintains the organic paper-curl curvature while being usable inline, theme-aware (`currentColor`), and personifiable as the "Recibito" character.

See `client/public/img/recibito/curve-comparison.html` for visual comparison of curve variants.
